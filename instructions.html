<!-- Introduction
Front-end web developers must know how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make interfaces work in an online environment. In Task 1, you acted as a web designer to create two low-level comprehensive page layouts. In this task, you will use your newly acquired web development skills to create a multipage website. You will use the same two low-level comprehensive page layouts you created in Task 1 as templates for the pages in this task.

Note: Because your site will be live, use caution with the content and images you include on your website. The public will have access to your website, so do not include any sensitive or private information.

Note: All the code in your submission must be your own original work. You may not use premade templates of any sort, including the templates provided in the exercise files of the course, blog software such as Blogger and WordPress, content management systems like Joomla! and PHP-Nuke, GUI web design software like Adobe Dreamweaver, or any type of WYSIWYG application that produces code by clicking a button.



Scenario
Congratulations! You got the job! You just finished your first week at the state government office where you completed the orientation and onboarding documentation. You have also met with your new supervisor daily to learn more about the department and expectations of your role, as well as your new colleagues who have been teaching you about the systems used in the office. You are now ready to develop the new website for the state government office.
Assumptions

Before you begin this task, remember that you should not begin working on Task 2 until Task 1 has been evaluated as a "Pass," as you will be building upon your work submitted in Task 1. Task 1 must be completed, submitted, and evaluated as a "Pass" before you submit this task. If your work on this task is not evaluated as a "Pass," you should contact your assigned instructor for guidance on how to make any necessary revisions.

 

As you begin, keep in mind that this task involves coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use the code editor of your choice to complete the task, but more advanced editors may be overkill. Plain text editors, such as Notepad, Notepad++, Atom, or Brackets, will work well.
Requirements

Your submission must represent your original work and understanding of the course material. Most performance assessment submissions are automatically scanned through the WGU similarity checker. Students are strongly encouraged to wait for the similarity report to generate after uploading their work and then review it to ensure Academic Authenticity guidelines are met before submitting the file for evaluation. See Understanding Similarity Reports for more information.  

Grammarly Note: 
Professional Communication will be automatically assessed through Grammarly for Education in most performance assessments before a student submits work for evaluation. Students are strongly encouraged to review the Grammarly for Education feedback prior to submitting work for evaluation, as the overall submission will not pass without this aspect passing. See Use Grammarly for Education Effectively for more information.  

Microsoft Files Note: 
Write your paper in Microsoft Word (.doc or .docx) unless another Microsoft product, or pdf, is specified in the task directions. Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc.  All supporting documentation, such as screenshots and proof of experience, should be collected in a pdf file and submitted separately from the main file. For more information, please see Computer System and Technology Requirements.  

 

You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.

 

A.  Create your project and working repository in GitLab. Use the link "GitLab How-To" located in the Supporting Documents section below to find step-by-step instructions for doing this important part of the task. You may also find the README file in GitLab useful. Be sure to do the following steps:

•   Clone the project to a local repository.

•   Commit with a message and push when you complete each requirement listed in parts B, C, D, and E.

 

Note: You may commit and push whenever you want to back up your changes, even if a requirement is not yet complete.

 

•   Submit a copy of the GitLab repository URL in the attached "Student Project Submission Form."

•   Submit a copy of the GitLab pages URL in the attached "Student Project Submission Form."

 

B.  Using the two low-level comprehensive page layouts you created in Task 1 as templates, use HTML and CSS to do the following:

1.  Create one home page for the website introducing your chosen state. This page will be the main entry point for the website.

2.  Create the following three interior pages:

 a.  Create one page to present information about the capital city of your chosen state, including the following facts:

•   the classification of the city: urban, suburban, and/or rural

•   the average income level of the city compared to the rest of the state

b.  Create two pages to present information about two noncapital cities of your choice located within the state, including the following facts about each city:

•   the city’s population

•   the year the city was incorporated

•   the region of the state in which the city is located

•   the classification of the city: urban, suburban, and/or rural

•   the average income level of the city compared to the rest of the state

 

Note: You may create additional city pages, but it is not a requirement.

 

3.  Create one page for a web form that includes the following elements:

•   text fields for first name, last name, and email address

•   a confirmation field where users will enter the email address for a second time

•   a text area that allows users to ask a question

•   labels for each form field

•   a "Submit" button

 

Note: The "Submit" button is not meant to submit the form’s information to a server.

 

Note: This web form is intended to collect information from users.

 

Note: You will add JavaScript to the web form page in part E below.

 

4.  Include the following elements in all pages from parts B1, B2 and B3:

•   a title in the head section of the source code

•   at least one relevant image, including alternative text for the image(s)

•   a consistent navigation system across all pages

•   the semantic elements you included in your two low-level comprehensive page layouts from Task 1

 

C.  Include each of the following elements within your website using well-formed HTML markup:

1.  a link that opens an external website in a new window or tab

2.  an ordered list with at least three list items

3.  an unordered list with at least three list items

4.  an HTML table consisting of at least three columns and at least three rows with content

 

D.  Create one external CSS stylesheet that includes the following CSS declarations and rules:

1.  one font-family declaration used at least once in the HTML files

2.  a :hover pseudo-class to create a rollover effect for the navigation links

3.  a float property to position one HTML element within the website to the side of another element

4.  absolute positioning on one page that changes the position of an element

5.  relative positioning on one page that changes the position of an element

6.  one of each of the following types of CSS selectors:

•   a functioning element selector that is used at least once on the website

•   a functioning class selector that is used twice on the same HTML page

•   a functioning id selector used at least once on the website

 

E.  Add JavaScript code to the web form created in part A3 that produces an alert box if the two email fields do not match.

 

F.  Create two images of the updated layouts based on the final site design using your chosen graphics software.

1.  Justify all changes made in Task 2 to your layouts from Task 1 (suggested length of 1–2 paragraphs).

 

Note: If no changes are made to your original layouts, you can upload your original design images for part F and state, "No changes were made for part F1."

 

G.  Submit a completed copy of the attached "Student Project Submission Form."

 

H.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.
