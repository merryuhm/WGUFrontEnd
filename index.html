 <!-- i added infra 6:44pm 6/4/25 -->

 <!-- 7:48pm took a break then added header and nav details to each page, connected each, did basic styles for each
  getting the basic structure of coding down
  trying to make it easy to update all pages at once -->

  <!-- 6:00pm 6/5 images added and style placeholder included -->


  <!-- 6:27pm added city details and a footer placeholder -->


  <!-- 6/6 5:34pm worked on this immediately after work, added ASK page details for form skeleton. added css selectors to stylesheet based on instructions. clearly highlighted instructions left to work on. -->

  <!-- NOTE: I want to make the images the aside, maybe, and anchor them so the articles wrap around it. use other state infograph website things as a reference? idk kinda lazy -->\


  <!-- add OL to ask page or something -->


  <!-- 8:41 6/7 I tried. Didnt do much but add to my layout and figure out where the 
   other needed elements and tables should go
   gotta rework some of what i already did but not much
   hopeful tomorrow will be more productive
    -->

    <!-- 7:51 6/10 coded for maybe 40 min? Tried 5 and fell into like a 30m sprint. Added a lot of images, links, and html items are now complete and unified. Copy text remains and needs to be adjusted. Ok some facts are missing. But the html ELEMENTS are all there. CSS next time. JS next next time. Or JS next time and CSS next next time? I dont even read my prior notes when I start on these though lol  -->

     <!-- 11:57 am i did section D but lowkey my relative position tag is ... not doing anything. :)  -->
